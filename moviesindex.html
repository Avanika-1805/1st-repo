    <h3>plot</h3>
    <p>Nandu is a hitman-for-hire, who is contracted for ₹1.5 crore (US$190,000) to fake an assassination attempt on opposition leader Shiva Reddy as part of the latter's plan to garner votes via sympathy to become the CM. After planning the hit and escape with his friend and partner-in-crime Malli, Nandu prepares to shoot, but someone shoots Shiva Reddy dead instead. The police immediately surround the building, and Nandu watches in shock as Malli is killed after his car collides with a tanker. Cornered by the police, Nandu jumps off the building and onto a train. In one of the compartments, he meets Pardhasaradhi Pardhu, who is returning to his village, Basarlapudi, after running away 12 years <br>

        Later that same night, the police arrive at Gudivada and the SI of the search party spots Nandu and fires at him, but accidentally hits Pardhu instead. Nandu escapes in the ensuing confusion and arrives at Basarlapudi, and thinking that he is Pardhu, the latter's family rejoices at his return. Pardhu's cousin Poori is instantly smitten with him and constantly tries to get his attention. As Nandu grows closer to his new family, he solves many of their problems. Nandu discloses his identity to Pardhu's childhood friend Ramana in a subsequent conversation. Pardhu's grandfather, Satya Narayana Murthy, shows Nandu a shotgun that Pardhu's father (his son) used for hunting, telling him that his son died after being hit with a ricocheting bullet caused by a stone plugging the barrel.
        
        Meanwhile, CBI officer Anjaneya Prasad is handed the case of Shiva Reddy's murder. His initial investigation turns up three issues:
        
        The weapon which was left was not fired
        That Shiva Reddy couldn't be shot in the center of the head from this angle.
        The police surrounded the building as if they were tipped off.
        He then follows the trail of the train and finds out about the death of actual Pardhu. Suspecting Pardhu may not be who he claims, and hoping to match his fingerprints to the gun present at the crime scene, Prasad arrives at Basarlapudi and questions Nandu and tries to get his fingerprints, but is <br>
        
        The subsequent investigation leads him to the accident that prevented Nandu from escaping; however, probing into that angle reveals that both vehicles involved in the accident (Malli's car and a petrol tanker) were hired by Malli, resulting in another dead end, leading to Prasad meeting with ex-gangster Sadhu, who is Nandu and Malli's mentor in prison. Sadhu confirms that Malli only plans the escape, and that Nandu is the one Prasad is looking for, leaving Prasad to realize that Nandu is masquerading as Pardhu. He also learns that they would have kept their money in banks, and locates Nandu's bank account by searching for accounts that had a sudden inflow of money in the days leading to Shiva Reddy's <br>
        
        Prasad learns of a transfer that took place recently, and heads to the destination bank to check, discovering the transfer was a ₹10 lakh (US$13,000) cheque encashed by Murthy for Poori's sister's marriage that was taken from Nandu's account. Prasad calls the house and tricks Nandu into responding to his real name. Nandu flees before Prasad arrives at the house. Prasad breaks the news of Pardhu's death to the family and of Nandu's masquerade, leaving them devastated. Nandu returns amidst outrage from the other family members for his deceit and explains that though he intended to break the news of Pardhu's death to the family, he couldn't bring himself to do it after meeting Pardhu's aunt and grandfather. He also explains that though he lied about Pardhu, he never tried to deceive the family by pretending to be Pardhu   <br>
        
        Murthy takes him into his study room, where he emphasizes that despite the chance to escape, Nandu came and helped the family with their issues, despite the family's criticisms, and had stood in silence in front of Murthy for no reason, which is why he considers Nandu as Pardhu. Murthy hands the family gun to Nandu, urging him to seek out who framed him and clear his name. Nandu calls up Shiva Reddy's deputy Baji Reddy and threatens him with the recording of their earlier conversation. From Baji Reddy, Nandu learns that Malli (who faked his death) called Baji Reddy after him that day and offered to do the job for half. Baji Reddy instead offered Malli ₹2 crore (US$250,000) to kill Shiva Reddy in a move to become the CM himself  <br>
        
        Letting Baji Reddy know that he recorded the conversation, Nandu heads to Malli's location; Prasad and the team spot him at an intersection, and one of Prasad's colleagues, Ravi opens fire at him but misses. Nandu manages to escape in the ensuing commotion, leaving Prasad to question Ravi on how much he was offered to kill Nandu. Nandu finds Malli in a church, and Malli reveals that instead of working along with Nandu and getting only half, he decided to take up Baji Reddy's offer and kill Shiva Reddy. By placing the blame on Nandu, Malli would get ₹2.5 crore (US$310,000) from both him and Baji Reddy. Both are ambushed by the SI and other officers sent by Baji Reddy, but Nandu dispatches the cops where he engages in hand-to-hand combat with Malli and overpowers him.  <br>
        
        Both run for a weapon, and Malli picks up Nandu's shotgun. Realizing that Nandu's gun is empty, Malli prepares to kill Nandu, only to be killed by the round backfiring, revealing a marble was stuck in the barrel. When Prasad arrives at the scene, he receives the recording from Nandu. Prasad meets with Baji Reddy and plays the Caasette. When Baji Reddy remarks that this won't guarantee his conviction, Prasad states that Shiva Reddy's son Pratap Reddy will kill Baji Reddy when he hears the cassette in court. Seeing no other option, Baji Reddy kills himself. Nandu immerses Pardhu's ashes and meets up with Prasad, who exonerates Nandu by placing the blame on Baji Reddy and Malli, allowing Nandu to return to Basarlapudi.</p>

    <h5>plot</h5>
    <p>
    A remote village named Pali in Andhra Pradesh is struck by an unknown disease, with several villagers dying each month. The village tantrik predicts a powerful man will come to their rescue as God. He assigns his assistant Siddhappa with the duty to find a man with such supernatural power and bring him to their village.  <br>

        A Gemini TV reporter named Babji arrives at Rajasthan to shoot a travel documentary where he comes across Alluri Seetharama Raju aka Raju, a short-tempered cab driver. Raju introduces himself to Babji and tells him the reason for him being in Rajasthan. Raju met a woman named Subhashini, whom he considers as bad luck to him, as she created a never-ending disasters for him and his cab. Later, he drives a scientist and his assistant to the Geological Survey office. Whilst returning a wallet to the scientist, Raju unwittingly witnesses the scientist and his assistant getting murdered, the latter of whom falls on and damages his cab. Raju's employer tasks him to deliver the cheque of ₹500,000 (US$6,300) to the assistant, Bilavar Singh's family in Girdwala, Rajasthan and get ₹100,000 (US$1,300) in return to pay for the damages. <br>
        
        Meanwhile, Subhashini's father, sugarcane businessman Durga Prasad, brings her a match, the son of his business partner named GK. The main reason for the proposal is to establish a strong project between Durga Prasad and GK. GK's son takes Subhashini to Rajasthan for a date. However, Subhashini runs away after she sees a packet of condoms from GK's son's pocket. GK finds out about it, informs Prasad and promises to bring Subhashini back. He sends his henchman Govardhan to Rajasthan in search of Subhashini. To Raju's dismay, Subhashini finds him and Babji and learns that she is in Rajasthan. Subhashini, Babji, Raju, and a botanist named Tom Cruise find Girdwala and hand the cheque to Bilavar's family, but Raju refuses to ask for the ₹100,000 (US$1,300) upon seeing the family's poverty. <br>
        
        Tom is forced to remain in the village as the villagers want to punish him for cutting a sentimental plant. Babji goes away with his shooting team but does not offer them a ride as he is scared of Subhashini's antics. As Raju and Subhashini wait for the bus to leave Girdwala, Govardhan's men stab Raju and take Subhashini after knocking her unconscious. However, Raju survives and kills almost all of Govardhan's men, while Govardhan himself escapes from the scenario, leaving Subhashini behind. Just as Raju goes unconscious, Sidhappa discovers him after all the omens the Tantrik predicts come true. Sidhappa and Subhashini take Raju to Pali, where the villagers treat his wounds. <br>
        
        After waking up, he finds all of the villagers praising him as their God, much to his dismay. He finds out from Subhashini that they are in Pali and that the villagers see him as the supernatural godsend that the Tantrik described and who will rescue the village. After a medical camp that is set up to help the villagers is ordered to shut down on GK's orders, Raju fights the men sent to quell unrest and unwittingly revives a dead girl, solidifying the villagers' belief in his powers. Initially reluctant to help them out, Raju escapes to Hyderabad, where he hands over Subhashini to her father.
        
        After realizing that Tom and Siddappa followed him to Hyderabad, Raju tests his fate and realizes the concept of deityhood. Deciding to solve the mystical series of deaths in the village he and Tom track down the doctor who had the medical camp closed, the dean of the medical college who signed the closure order and Govardhan. Raju interrogates them and discovers that the plastic factory in Pali deposits its wastes in the drinking water source nearby, thus contaminating and killing the villagers. <br>
        
        Interrogating Durga Prasad's lawyer Miriyam, Raju finds out that GK wanted Subhashni and his son married so that he could use Prasad's sugarcane to create plastic. Encountering the scientist's assistant, Raju forces her to reveal the truth, that the scientist, Dr Paranji had stopped at Girdwal, and discovered the idol of Krishna they worshipped to be made of iridium, a valuable metal. Tracing its origin back to Pali, Paranji reported his findings to GK, who planned to mine the iridium for his own profit but couldn't convince Paranji to side with him. Warning him that it would not end well for him if he tried to go public, GK decided to use the villagers's superstitions against them and make them voluntarily vacate the village so that he could mine the iridium without any issue.  <br>
        
        Despite GK's warning to Paranji not to reveal it to anybody else, Praranji tries to inform the Geological Survey about the deposits, which was why he and Bilavar, who was with him, were killed that day. GK also decided to dispose of Raju as he was an unexpected witness. GK lured Raju to Girdwala under the cover of delivering the insurance cheque to Bilavar's family, which was planted and was attacked by Govardhan. GK needed the strong plasticglass from the plastic factory to pack the iridium. <br>
        
        GK kills his assistant and Govardhan for their failures. He then heads to Pali to kill all the villagers before the truth goes out to the public. The Tantrik warns GK that his greed would be his downfall, that Raju would save the villagers and bring death to GK, and keep Pali's population at 534, not letting any more die in the process. Raju arrives at Pali along with Sidhappa. GK shoots and kills Sidhappa, reducing the population to 533. Before dying, Siddhappa dies peacefully in Raju's arms. Enraged, Raju massacres GK's men and severs GK's palm. A terrified GK tries to run with Raju in pursuit. Raju catches up to him, and GK dies when a religious knife hanging from a nearby tree falls and stabs him in the neck after Raju curses him to die. The Tantrik reveals that Raju fulfilled his mission as God to save the village because although Sidhappa was killed, another baby was born to keep the village's population at 534. A new flag is being raised in the honor of child's birth.  <br>
